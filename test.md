- test UserContext with a mock
- jest.mock('../../context/UserContext') -> this will mock the context file
- so that you can use the mock user
- define the shape of a mockUser if I am logged in, mockUser ={{shape of user object}}
- Mocking behaviors:
  - Auth sign in and sign out
  - Create, Edit, Delete a Job
  - initialEntries with mock URL for ex
